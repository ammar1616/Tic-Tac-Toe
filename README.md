Minimax Tic Tac Toe
The key to the Minimax algorithm is a back and forth between the two players, 
where the player whose "turn it is" desires to pick the move with the maximum score. 
In turn, the scores for each of the available moves are determined by the opposing player deciding which of its available moves has the minimum score.
